### COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis using .Net  Framework (C#)

- In this tutorial, we'll perform analysis on COVID-19 dataset and visualize the trends of virus spread in various countries
- Tutorial is divided into below parts
  - **Part-1:** [COVID-19 Data Analysis using .Net DataFrame API](https://github.com/praveenraghuvanshi1512/covid-19/tree/master/part-1)
  - **Part-2:** [COVID-19 Prediction using ML.Net framework](https://github.com/praveenraghuvanshi1512/covid-19/tree/master/part-2)
- We'll leverage recently introduced support for C# in Jupyter Notebook
